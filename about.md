I am currently a first year Ph.D. student at the Department of Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. My primary research interests are Statistical Genetics, Causal Inference and Machine Learning. I am also interested in the intersection of Health and Linguistics.

Previously, in 2021, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Statistics at the Indian Statistical Institute. In 2023, I completed my Master's degree in Statistics from the same institute.
