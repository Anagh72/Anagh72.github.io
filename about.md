I am currently an incoming Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. My primary research interests are Biostatistics, Health Economics, Health Policy and Machine Learning. I am also interested in the intersection of Health and Linguistics.

Previously, in 2021, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Statistics at the Indian Statistical Institute. In 2023, I will be completing my Master's degree in Statistics from the same university.
